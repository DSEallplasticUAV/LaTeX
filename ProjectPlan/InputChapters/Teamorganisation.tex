\chapter{Team organization}
\label{Chapter:Teamorganization}
In this chapter the team organization is presented and elaborated upon. First the individual skills of each team member within a team are investigated, after which the tasks are divided. Next, specialist teams were formed for different disciplines. The visualisation of the final organization is shown by means of an organogram. \\

The team started organising itself by investigating the personalities of the team members, to see what type of role each team member could be assigned to. This was done by using a Belbin\cite{website:belbin} self-perception test, which indicates a percentage score for different types of characters. The results of this test are shown in  \autoref{tab:belbin}. The required positions within the team were determined as well, in order to have responsibility for every aspect of the project work including the software used. The following roles were defined:

\begin{itemize}
\item Chairman
\item Secretary
\item Quality Assurance (2 positions)
\item Systems Engineering (2 positions)
\item MATLAB coordinator
\item CATIA coordinator
\item LATEX coordinator
\item Presentation \& Poster coordinator

\end{itemize}


\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Main 'Belbin' team roles}
\label{tab:belbin}
   \begin{tabular}{| l | c | } \hline
   
     \textbf{Team member} & \textbf{Main role(s)}  \\ \hline
     Momchil Jeliazkov & Specialist  \\ \hline
     Ties Kerssemakers & Implementer  \\ \hline
     Kevin Mooi & Implementer, Teamworker  \\ \hline
     Martjn Roelofs & Shaper  \\ \hline
     Jannick Seelen & Shaper  \\ \hline
     Bas Van den Kieboom & Teamworker, Implementer  \\ \hline
     Perrin Vendrig & Monitor Evaluator, Implementer  \\ \hline
     Carel Verhoeff & Monitor Evaluator  \\ \hline
     Boudewijn de Heij & Implementer  \\ \hline
     Rick van Stralen & Monitor Evaluator \\ \hline
    
     \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The chairman will take the responsibility of checking all team members to do their assigned tasks and work effectively, as well as keeping track of the progress of the project by means of checklists such that deadlines and deliverables are met at specified times. The secretary keeps track of all decisions made during group discussions and notes issues and questions regarding the project. The Quality Assurance team makes sure that all documents and deliverables are of sufficient quality, both technically as well as visually. The System Engineering team keeps track of the communications and the flow of information between different groups such that all team members get the correct inputs when needed and deliver the right outputs to the right groups on time. The MATLAB coordinator is responsible for the MATLAB part of the project and makes sure that issues with this program can be solved. The CATIA coordinator is responsible for the CATIA deliverables and makes sure these have sufficient quality. The LATEX coordinator is in charge of the LATEX files and the structure of the documents. The Presentation \& Poster coordinator makes sure that the presentations and poster are made before the respective deadlines and have the correct informative content.\\

Next, the team members were split up into specialist teams. These teams will take the responsibility of the different disciplines of which the project consists. By assigning all the important tasks that need to be performed per discipline, the number of team members necessary per discipline was decided. The following specialist teams can be recognized:

\begin{itemize}
\item Aerodynamics (2 positions)
\item Performance and Propulsion (2 positions)
\item Stability and Control (2 positions)
\item Materials and Structures (4 positions)
\item Payload (2 positions)
\end{itemize}

Both the team role division and the specialist teams division resulting from the decisions made are shown in the organogram in \autoref{fig:Orgroles}. At the top, the DSE project is linked with the supporting staff. To the left, the roles are shown. The chairman has the leading role over the specialist teams, shown to the right. 
The divisions are not definite for the rest of the project. Switches will be made during the course of the project and every team member will be chairman for one week.
